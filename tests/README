To get going on the tests, simply copy the files in this folder into your current project 
directory (where your files are).

After you have copied in all necessary files, to run all the tests, simply type:

  ./run-tests.csh

To run a specific test, type:

  ./run-tests.csh <testNumber>

as in

  ./run-tests.csh 1 

Running a specific test may be useful to debug a particular problem you
are having. 

Here are the commands the tests are supposed to check:

 0 ./raidsim -level 0 -strip 2 -disks 6 -size 100 -trace simple-trace.txt -verbose
 1 ./raidsim -level 10 -strip 2 -disks 6 -size 100 -trace simple-trace.txt -verbose
 2 ./raidsim -level 0 -strip 5 -disks 10 -size 1000 -trace second-trace.txt -verbose
 3 ./raidsim -level 10 -strip 5 -disks 10 -size 1000 -trace second-trace.txt -verbose

If, after following these directions you still are not able to pass some or all of the tests,
please let me know so that we can work out any kinks that may potentially still exist.
